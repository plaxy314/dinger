My fondest childhood memory is discussing physics with my father. He is self-taught and never received a formal education. To make a living, he drifted through a series of odd jobs—carpenter, chemist, and accountant. Along the way, he taught me how to build electric motors and transformers. I was fascinated by how these things worked.

In high school, I took several physics classes and dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist. In college, however, I came to realize that I was terrible at mathematics and unlikely to make a career in physics. I studied biology and computer science, and eventually became a software engineer at a small search company.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, solitude forced one to reflect. Life felt so fragile, as if any moment could be our last. I decided to leave my corporate job and return to the simple question that had drawn me since I was a child: *How does the world work?*

朝花夕拾 means “Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk.” I am grateful that I still have some time to gather the scattered flowers of my childhood dream before everything turns to dust. I learned physics from the dead. This is the conversation I imagine them having now.

**Richard P. Feynman** *So what happened to the old theory that I fell in love with as a youth? Well, I would say it’s become an old lady, that has very little attractive left in her and the young today will not have their hearts pound anymore when they look at her. But, we can say the best we can for any old woman, that she has been a very good mother and she has given birth to some very good children.*

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi&= e^{i 2\pi \cdot z} \\
z&= \frac{S}{h} = \frac{t}{\tau} = \frac{x}{\lambda} \\
h&= E \tau \le \Delta E \Delta t  \\
h&= p \lambda \le \Delta p \Delta x \\
c&=\frac{\lambda}{\tau} =\lambda f \\
m&=\frac{E}{c^2}=\frac{h\tau}{\lambda^2} \\
\vec{f}&= \frac{\vec{p}}{\tau} = \frac{E}{\vec{\lambda}} = \frac{h}{ \tau \vec{\lambda}}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(\mathbf{x}_{out}, t) = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{Paths}} c_p \psi(\mathbf{x}_{in}, t_0) \\
\rho(x,t)= \frac{1}{i2\pi} \bar{\psi}(x,t) \dot{\psi}(x,t) \\
P(x, t) = \int_{t-\frac{\Delta t}{2}}^{t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}}  \int_{x-\frac{\Delta x}{2}}^{x+\frac{\Delta x}{2}} \rho(x',t') \mathrm{d} x' \mathrm{d} t' 
\end{align*}
$$

**Richard P. Feynman:** *One might still like to ask: “How does it work? What is the machinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the law. No one can “explain” any more than we have just “explained.” No one will give you any deeper representation of the situation. We have no ideas about a more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced.*

**Albert Einstein:** *But, if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.*

**Richard P. Feynman:** *I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.*

**John Archibald Wheeler:** *Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it - in a decade, a century, or a millennium - we will all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise? How could we have been so stupid?*

**Richard P. Feynman:** *Sure, physics is like sex. It may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.*
