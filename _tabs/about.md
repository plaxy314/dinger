My fondest childhood memory is talking about physics with my father.
He was self-taught and never received a formal education. To make a
living, he drifted through a series of odd jobs—carpenter, chemist,
accountant. Along the way, he taught me how to build electric motors
and transformers. I was captivated by how these machines worked, by
the hidden order beneath their moving parts.

In high school, I took several physics classes and dreamed of becoming
a theoretical physicist. In college, however, I came to realize that
I was terrible at mathematics and unlikely to make a career in physics.
I turned instead to biology and computer science, and eventually became
a software engineer at a small search company.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, life suddenly felt fragile, as if any moment
might be our last. We are all given roughly the same amount of time in this
world; what matters is how consciously we choose to spend it. A busy life
is a wasted life. I chose to leave my corporate job and return to the
simple question that had intrigued me since childhood: *How does the
universe operate?*

朝花夕拾 may be translated as "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk". I am grateful
that I still have time to gather the scattered flowers of my childhood dreams,
to hold them once more before everything turns to dust.

We must learn from those we will never meet. I like to imagine the
conversations they might be having now.

**Richard P. Feynman** *So what happened to the old theory that I fell
in love with as a youth? Well, I would say it’s become an old lady, 
that has very little attractive left in her and the young today will not
have their hearts pound anymore when they look at her. But, we can say
the best we can for any old woman, that she has been a very good mother
and she has given birth to some very good children.*

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi&= e^{i 2\pi \cdot z} \\
z&= \frac{S}{h} = \frac{t}{\tau} = \frac{x}{\lambda} \\
h&= E \tau \le \Delta E \Delta t  \\
h&= p \lambda \le \Delta p \Delta x \\
c&=\frac{\lambda}{\tau} =\lambda f \\
m&=\frac{E}{c^2}=\frac{h\tau}{\lambda^2} \\
\vec{f}&= \frac{\vec{p}}{\tau} = \frac{E}{\vec{\lambda}} = \frac{h}{ \tau \vec{\lambda}}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(\mathbf{x}_{out}, t) = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{Paths}} c_p \psi(\mathbf{x}_{in}, t_0) \\
\rho(x,t)= \frac{1}{i2\pi} \bar{\psi}(x,t) \dot{\psi}(x,t) \\
P(x, t) = \int_{t-\frac{\Delta t}{2}}^{t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}}  \int_{x-\frac{\Delta x}{2}}^{x+\frac{\Delta x}{2}} \rho(x',t') \mathrm{d} x' \mathrm{d} t' 
\end{align*}
$$

**Richard P. Feynman:** *One might still like to ask: “How does it work? What
is the machinery behind the law?” No one has found any machinery behind the
law. No one can “explain” any more than we have just “explained.” No one will
give you any deeper representation of the situation. We have no ideas about a
more basic mechanism from which these results can be deduced.*

**Albert Einstein:** *But, if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand
it well enough.*

**Richard P. Feynman:** *I think I can safely say that nobody understands
quantum mechanics.*

**John Archibald Wheeler:** *Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so
beautiful, that when we grasp it - in a decade, a century, or a millennium - we
will all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise? How could we have
been so stupid?*

**Galileo Galilei** *All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered;
the point is to discover them.*

**Max Born** *I have tried to read philosophers of all ages and have found many
illuminating ideas but no steady progress toward deeper knowledge and
understanding. Science, however, gives me the feeling of steady progress: I am
convinced that theoretical physics is actual philosophy.*

**Galileo Galilei** *Mathematics is the language in which God has written the
universe.*

**Charles Darwin** *I have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough
at least to understand something of the great leading principles of mathematics,
for men thus endowed seem to have an extra sense.*

**Ludwig Boltzmann** *If you ask me about my innermost conviction whether our
century will be called the century of iron or the century of steam or
electricity, I answer without hesitation: it will be called the century of
the mechanical view of nature, the century of Darwin.*

**Albert Einstein:** *The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity
has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he
contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of
reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this
mystery each day.*

Men rise and fall like winter wheat, but the ideas they left behind will never die.
