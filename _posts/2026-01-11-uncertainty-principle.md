To resolve a single action—that is, to observe the event of an ant crossing a reference point from start to end—the measurable resolutions in time, length, energy, and momentum are bounded below by the fundamental units associated with that action:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta t \geq \tau, \quad \Delta x &\geq \lambda, \\
\Delta E \geq \overline{E}, \quad \Delta p &\geq \overline{p}.
\end{aligned}
$$

These inequalities define the fundamental limits of measurement for the system. Any attempt to probe or describe the system at finer resolutions inevitably introduces uncertainty, as no individual action can be fully resolved at such scales.

Consider that time and energy, as well as length and momentum, are not independent observables. The limits are often expressed in the familiar form:

$$
 \Delta{E} \Delta{t} \geq \overline{E}\tau = h, \quad  \\
 \Delta p \Delta x \geq \overline{p} \lambda =  h,
$$

where $h$ denotes the action of a single ant step.

These uncertainty relations do not arise from imperfect instruments or experimental error, but from the discrete, action-based nature of motion itself. An ant does not move continuously; instead, it advances through indivisible steps with characteristic duration and length. As a result, time, position, energy, and momentum can only be defined meaningfully at scales larger than those of a single action.
